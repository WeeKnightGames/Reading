*Reading---the Protagonist Game*---is a story-first, narrative-driven, dice-less, rules-light role-playing game (RPG) designed for one or more players to enjoy for 10 minutes to 10 hours. Reading takes the players on fantastical journeys of love and loss, hope and despair, action and adventure as crafted by some of the greatest minds this world has ever known.

# Rules

1. Find a work of fiction that appeals to all of the players.
2. Select a number of characters in that work of fiction equal to the number of players.
3. Each player selects one of the characters to play and provides them with a name.
4. Select one player to act as the Storyteller. The Storyteller reads the work of fiction and takes care to use the player-chosen names whenever that character is referenced in the fiction.
5. Rotate who acts as the Storyteller. Perhaps each Storyteller reads one page, one act, one chapter, one part, or the entire work of fiction.
6. Have fun immersing yourself in another world!

# Example of Play

Jack and Jill, a married couple, decide to play. After much discussion, they agree on playing through *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen and download it from Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42671) or purchase it at a local bookstore or internet retailer. They browse through the book and decide on two characters: Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. Jack decides to play Mr. Darcy and gives him the name Sir Arthur. Jill decides to play Elizabeth and gives her the name Marianne. They decide Jill will act as the first Storyteller and so she begins reading...

> Chapter One. It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

> ...
>
> Marianne Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Sir Arthur had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.

For those of you familiar with *Pride and Prejudice*, you will notice that in Chapter Three, Jill was careful to replace Elizabeth's name with her character's name Marianne and to replace Mr. Darcy's name with Jack's character's name Sir Arthur.

That's all there is to *Reading---the Protagonist Game*. So go out, invite a few friends, and get to gaming!
