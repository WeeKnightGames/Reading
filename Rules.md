Reading---the Protagonist Game---is a story-first, narratively-driven, rules-light roll-playing game (RPG) designed for one or more players to enjoy for 10 minutes to 10 hours. Reading takes the players on fantastical journeys of love and loss, hope and despair, action and adventure as crafted by some of the greatest minds this world has ever known.

# Rules

1. Find a work of fiction that appeals to all of the players.
2. Select a number of characters in that work of fiction equal to the number of players.
3. Each player selects one of the characters to play and provides them with a name.
4. Select one player to act as the Storyteller. The Storyteller reads the work of fiction and takes care to use the player chosen names whenever that character is referenced in the fiction.
5. Rotate who acts as the Storyteller. Perhaps each Storyteller reads one page, one act, one chapter, one part, or the entire work of fiction.
6. Have fun immersing yourself in another world!
